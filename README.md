# CS 4372-Assignment 3: Deep Learning
Assignment conducted in CS 4372.501.F22 course with fellow classmate Ian Lunt. In this assignment, we used an image dataset that had half of the images being pizzas and the other half a different food item. We want to determine if a particular image is a pizza or not.

## Jupyter Notebook Information:
The file path for the dataset is Ian's dataset repository. The notebook was created in Google Colab and it creates directories.
